# UniFi Dream SE as Core Network Hub

- I utilize the UniFi Dream Machine SE (UDM SE) as the central component of my home network, leveraging both the UniFi Network and UniFi Protect applications for comprehensive management.
- The UniFi Protect app enables seamless integration and monitoring of multiple security cameras connected to the UDM SE, ensuring robust video surveillance.
- A UniFi 16-port switch (8 PoE + 8 standard ports) is deployed to efficiently power cameras and other network devices across my setup.
